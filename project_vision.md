# Project Vision

As students, we are enthusiastic about analyzing the data related to the various tumors found in Wisconsin breast cancer patients. Breast cancer is a severe and widespread illness. We desire to discover patterns in the data to better inform patients and physicians of the type of cancer they are dealing with, thus allowing them to form appropriate treatment plans. Moreover, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the severity of malignant and benign tumors and use this knowledge in our analysis. Our ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes, increase awareness and spur progress toward finding a cure for this devastating illness. We wish to live in a future in which breast cancer is more comprehensively understood and eventually defeated and is flexible enough to accommodate any changes and advances in the field.
