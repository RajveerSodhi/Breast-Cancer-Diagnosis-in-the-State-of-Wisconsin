# Group 24 - Breast Cancer Diagnosis in the State of Wisconsin

## Introduction

A common and deadly disease, breast cancer affects countless people worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer is essential for successful treatment and a better prognosis. Our project examines and demonstrates the relationships between particular breast tumour characteristics and whether they are classified as malignant or benign. We hope to understand better the factors affecting benign or malignant tumour growth by identifying the most important ones. We're passionate about this topic because we want to improve early detection and look into how our findings might affect clinical decision-making. Ultimately, we hope patients, healthcare workers, and the medical community will significantly benefit from our efforts better to understand the connections between tumour traits and diagnosis.
