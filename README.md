## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are interested in analyzing a breast cancer diagnosis dataset to better understand the characteristics of cancerous and non-cancerous cells in a breast mass and how these attributes can be used to accurately predict a patient's diagnosis. Analyzing this dataset will not only increase our understanding of the disease but also help find patterns associated with tumor growth and lead to improved diagnostic and treatment methods. This analysis may also highlight disparities or inequalities in access to healthcare, which can then be targeted for problem solving initiatives. Finally, we believe that analyzing this dataset is a valuable opportunity to make a meaningful impact in the fight against breast cancer.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset was created by analyzing several papers and diagnosis of breast cancer patients in the state of Wisconsin. The dataset has a class distribution of 357 benign and 212 malignant instances of a tumor and 30 numerical features generated from digital images of FNA of a breast lump, and a diagnosis label of either benign or malignant.  Each row discusses the tumor in detail, by looking into the radius of the lump, texture and perimeter for example. We found the dataset on kaggle.com, which is a reputed source to find quality datasets. This data was originally found in the UCI Machine Learning repository and was created by doctors working at the University of Wisconsin.
