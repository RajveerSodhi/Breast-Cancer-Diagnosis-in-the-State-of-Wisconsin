## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are interested in analyzing a breast cancer diagnosis dataset to better understand the characteristics of cancerous and non-cancerous cells in a breast mass and how these attributes can be used to accurately predict a patient's diagnosis. Analyzing this dataset will not only increase our understanding of the disease but also help find patterns associated with tumor growth and lead to improved diagnostic and treatment methods. This analysis may also highlight disparities or inequalities in access to healthcare, which can then be targeted for problem solving initiatives. Finally, we believe that analyzing this dataset is a valuable opportunity to make a meaningful impact in the fight against breast cancer.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set consists of measurements of breast cancer cases that Dr. William H. Wolberg, a medical professional at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison gathered to study trends between benign and malignant cancers. Dr. Wolberg was accompanied in this endeavor by W. Nick Street and Olvi L. Mangasarian from the Computer Sciences department of the university. The data was originally collected in 1992, with the diagnostic version of the dataset being compiled in 1995. To record this data, a Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass was taken and features were calculated from that image. The data set has a diagnosis label of either benign (B) or malignant (M) for 569 cases in 30 data columns produced from digital images of an FNA of a breast lump. The hospital treated the patients who underwent FNAs, and the photographs of the vast majority were digitized. To assess the severity of the mass, the features of the masses were computed. Through this data set, the general public will benefit from understanding what various cancer forms might resemble.
